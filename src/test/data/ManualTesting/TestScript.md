# Manual Testng
###### Loading of Manual Testing
``` 1. Since our program only reads xml files with the task name "taskmanger.xml", the SampleData.xml file has to be manually renamed to taskmanager.xml
	2. After renaming SampleData.xml to taskmanager.Xml, enter "cd src/test/data/ManualTesting/" in the command box. Now the to-do list has to restart.
	3. Re launch the to-do list and all the sample data should be loaded onto the task manager.
	4. 

```
