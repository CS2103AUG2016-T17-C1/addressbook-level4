## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>

**A2**: An alternate way would be to use the inbuilt storage transfer command `cd` and File Hosting services such as dropbox.<br>
		Using the `cd` command, change the working directory of Never Forget & also select the option to transfer the tasks to a folder on dropbox.<br>
		From the other computer,use `cd` to change **_only_** the working directory of Never Forget to the same folder on dropbox.<br>
		Lastly, if needed, change the working directory of Never Forget & also select the option to transfer the tasks to a _**local**_ folder.
